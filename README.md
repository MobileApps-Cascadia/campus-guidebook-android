interested in Cascadia find their way to events and destinations.


# Customers

Campus grounds and buildings. Our application will help you find your way along
with helping you get connected with the many clubs offered at Cascadia.

* Like new students, current students can find it hard to know where
events take place. Because of the variety of clubs offered at Cascadia, it can be
confusing finding the meetings. Our application will tell you the date, time, and
location on the map where the event will take place.

* you are the leader of the sustainability club. you want to get the word out about an upcoming event.
the guidebook application will allow you to add an event and get the word out.
